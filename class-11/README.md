## Lecture

### Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 11 of Code 201, students will be able to:

- Display some number of randomly selected images in a web document, and track clicks on those images, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.
- Use principles of Object-Oriented Programming to manage their vote tracker project, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.
- Retrieve data from an array of image objects and display that data as a list in the DOM, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.
