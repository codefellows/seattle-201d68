                    After years in the commercial fishing industry, Pat felt he needed a change of pace. His long months
                    at sea were taxing on his body, so he took up baking with his family (pictures left) as a hobbie. As
                    a born-and-raised Seattlite, he had a deep love for coffee and coffee-time confections. As a career
                    fisherman, he also had a deep love for Salmon. He decided to combine these two things and, thus,
                    Pat's Salmon Cookies were born. Our slogan is "there's nothing fishy about these cookies" because we
                    use sustainably sourced fish and organic ingredients. Along with introducing the world to his new
                    recipe, he wanted to produce a product that was green, clean and sustainable. We currently have
                    locations in 5 major cities, but expansion is in the works! We also have salmon cookies merch in the
                    form of t-shirts and cookie cutters that'll make the perfect gift for your friends and family!
